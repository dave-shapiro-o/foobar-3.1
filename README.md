My Java solution to the foobar level 3 question "Bomb, baby!".
I included a main method to test the solution.

After failing 2 of the hidden test cases, probably due to timing out 
(the numbers can be anything below 10^50!),
I found some hints online for optimising the program at

(thanks!)

There is a bit of repetition in my implementation, 
but my attempts to refactor only made things less readable.
i.e. it ain't pretty but it works!
